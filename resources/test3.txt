While Jeb Bush has reportedly conceded his debating needs work, his campaign continues to emphasize his governing experience with his new e-book and a new video.

Bush has gone home to Florida for two days of campaigning through the state, on Friday and Monday. After a tough debate in Colorado , Bush is in Punta Gorda, Florida on Friday for the annual "Hurricane Bowl" football game played between Charlotte High School and Port Charlotte High School. It's an effort by the campaign to promote his new e-book "Reply All," highlighting his leadership as governor of Florida.

As part of the rollout, the campaign released a six-minute video feature titled, "Divided by a River, United by a Storm," which tells the story of how Hurricane Charley devastated the Punta Gorda area in August of 2004, wiping out the facilities at Charlotte High School. It plays up Bush's push to make sure that classes for students at Charlotte High School were in session by the end of the month which ultimately resulted in Charlotte High School students sharing the facilities at neighboring rival Port Charlotte High School.
